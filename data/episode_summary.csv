He won't be able to look at her father. Leonard is a funnyman, but he's Leonard. Leonard is Dr Koothrappali's son. Raj's parents won't have any grandchildren because he has a low sperm count. Sheldon is the one who ruined everything, because he ruined everything. Raj has a low sperm count. Mrs Koothrappali sent him boxers with a warning label. Sheldon will tell them what he did to them. Raj and Leonard are angry at Sheldon for leaving with his date. Sheldon is sorry he left with him, but he doesn't have to tell them what he did. Sheldon and Dr Koothrappali are angry at Raj for being drunk and boring. Raj is not an alcoholic, he was drunk one time, but he was just this one time. Dr Koothrappali and Leonard want to talk to Rajesh in private. Raj has to go, so he will wait for Leonard and Sheldon outside. Lalita and Sheldon ate, she lectured Sheldon on the link between gum disease and heart attacks. Sheldon is not going to see Lalita again as he has a dentist. Leonard and Sheldon wonder who's going to tell his parents that they're not having grandchildren. Sheldon already has a dentist, so he doesn't have to tell them. Life has a way of amusing us and bruising us. Penny turned out to be kind of slutty. Leonard and Penny are going to do their experiments. Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine."
s01e09	Leonard and Howard are online. Howard is about to send a signal from the laptop through their local ISP to San Francisco. The signal will be sent to a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where it will be handed off to transatlantic cables. Howard explains to Sheldon and Raj that the data will be transmitted via submerged transatlantic cables to Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to their ISP. Howard and Raj are going to listen to 2001 on the stereo. The stereo is not ready yet, so Howard should go for the stereo instead of the laptop. Leonard and Sheldon turned the stereo down with their laptop. Penny turned it down with her laptop. San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax and Halifax are the cities they visited. Sheldon and Leonard turned their stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the Internet. Penny should get one of those universal remotes at RadioShack. Someone in Sichuan Province, China is using his computer to turn the lights on and off in Penny's and Leonard's house. Penny will see Leonard soon. Penny, Sheldon, Howard, Leonard and All together are sending a message about the remote-control cars. The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, the blue Viper is from suburban Tel Aviv. Howard is running the red Corvette from suburban Tel Aviv. Penny doesn't want to put on slacks, but Leonard tells her to do it. Sheldon and Raj don't want to be disembodied brains in jars in the future. Raj wants his brain in an android body. Howard wants to make sure he would still be Jewish. Howard wants to make sure if he's a synthetic human, he'd still be Jewish. He promised his mother. Raj, Sheldon and Sheldon don't want him to have his android penis circumcised. Leonard and Sheldon are going to present their paper on the properties of supersolids at the Topical Conference on Bose-Einstein Condensates at the Institute for Experimental Physics. Leonard is at the Topical Conference on Bose-Einstein Condensates. Sheldon didn't want to give a speech at the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott. Sheldon and Howard were at the Topical Conference on Bose-Einstein Condensates parties. Leonard got a Nobel Prize and he doesn't know about other honors. The day Sheldon wins a Nobel Prize is the day he begins his research on the drag coefficient of tassels on flying carpets. Howard thinks Sheldon's mama's research methodology is flawed, but they have to do this. Leonard thinks Sheldon is the lead author because he went alphabetically. Sheldon thinks it was Leonard's idea. Sheldon is not the leadAuthor. Sheldon is the author. Leonard designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis and he's going to the conference to present it. Sheldon doesn't want to give his word and wants the scientific community to believe him. Leonard is going to the conference to present his and Sheldon's findings. Sheldon forbids him from taking credit for their work, but he's throwing Leonard a bone. Oh, no, he didn't. Leonard and Sheldon are still not talking to each other. Sheldon is doing a thing where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. Leonard and Penny are going to look for a new corduroy suit for Leonard. They are also going to take a look at some other pieces Leonard has sent Penny. Penny wants Leonard to throw out the stuff she doesn't want him to try on. It's the Bottle City of Kandor, the capital city of Krypton. Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton. It was miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and rescued by Superman. Leonard will put on a shirt and sport coat. Leonard is going to put the pants on. He will be back in a moment. Penny will not look. Leonard and Sheldon are not going to compromise on the presentation. Leonard sent Penny a picture of his Battlestar Galactica flight suit. He didn't wear it on Halloween, because Sheldon is batshit crazy. Leonard didn't wear his flight suit on Halloween because it's not a costume. He wore a paisley shirt and a corduroy suit. It's his only tie. Leonard has been wearing this tie since the eighth grade. It's his only tie, but it's reversible, so it works as two. Penny has all his clothes. Leonard has been wearing the same clothes since the eighth grade. Penny wants him to put down the corduroy suit and wear something else. He refuses. Penny got the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly in her mailbox. Sheldon's mailbox didn't come to him, which is weird, because his came to him. Penny and Sheldon are going to climb the stairs in silence. Penny is going to tip the waitresses. She will be here for the whole week. Penny and Sheldon had a little misunderstanding. Leonard and Leonard had a misunderstanding. Penny and Sheldon will put it in Leonard's pocket and Zip it, lock it. Leonard and Sheldon had a misunderstanding about Galileo and the pope. Leonard feels bad about it. Penny was talking to Leonard this morning. Sheldon doesn't understand why it's difficult to fight with your best friend. Sheldon couldn't poop this morning. Penny suggests he should talk to him about it. Sheldon is not sure if it's an issue of physiological manifestations or some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil. Leonard values Sheldon as a friend and would not have come up with the experiment without Sheldon's little idea. Sheldon will talk to Leonard about it. Penny didn't understand what he said to her. Leonard has been thinking and wants to argue about this instead of arguing about it. He had a lucky hunch, so he's coming out. Leonard and Sheldon will not speak to each other again, because Sheldon doesn't want to talk to Leonard again. Penny has heard it from Sheldon. Leonard is leaving for the conference. He will present his 'lucky hunch' to Penny. Sheldon doesn't like the way he said it. Leonard and Sheldon did the work together and they will present the paper together. Sheldon is not interested in presenting the paper. Sheldon and Penny are going to say goodbye. (GRUNTS) One of these days Howard checked the house. There's probably 20, 25 people in there. 25 is Woodstock in particle physics, according to Leonard. The side of the house is less stained. Leonard is nervous, because he wasn't expecting such a crowd. He will open with a joke about chickens that won't lay any eggs. The farmer calls a physicist to help. Leonard and Penny are laughing at the physicist's joke that only works for spherical chickens in a vacuum. Penny has heard the joke before, but she doesn't remember it. Howard, Leonard, Penny and Penny are going to meet. Penny should have brought her own car, but she didn't. She should've brought a suit. So in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero... ...the moment of inertia changes and the solid becomes a supersolid... ...which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Thank you. Leonard has skipped over the part of the paper that Sheldon is the lead author of. Sheldon has no other questions. Sheldon is Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who is the paper's lead author. Leonard was walking through the park and saw children on a merry-go-round. Sheldon skipped over the part where he was thinking about the moment of inertia. Leonard is not happy with Sheldon's presentation. Sheldon is arrogant and doesn't need validation from lesser minds. Sheldon is not Isaac Newton. Sheldon came to see Leonard. Leonard and Sheldon are arguing. Sheldon came to the meeting because he knew Leonard would screw it up. Leonard has had enough of Sheldon's condescension and tells him off. Leonard Hofstadter is an egotist who needs to get his self-esteem from strangers to feel good about himself. Sheldon thinks he's smarter than everyone else in the room. Leonard and Sheldon are arguing. Sheldon hit Leonard and tried to blow up Leonard's head with his mind. Leonard will settle for an aneurism. He hit Sheldon. Leonard and Sheldon are grunting. Penny and Howard are in the front row. This is a splash zone. It's usually how these physics things go. Leonard wants to hit Sheldon with a Vulcan nerve pinch. Sheldon doesn't want to be hit with a pinch, so Leonard gets Sheldon on the floor instead. Leonard offered Sheldon a ride home, but Sheldon refused. Sheldon will take Leonard's apology as it's not much of an apology, but he will take it. Leonard wants to apologize to Sheldon. Sheldon apologizes to Leonard for trying to blow up Leonard's head. Howard and Raj saw the whole thing on YouTube. Sheldon tried to hit Howard. Howard hit him. Sheldon tried to blow up Howard's head. It was a featured video. It's a splash zone in the front row. Howard's fingernails hurt, so he needs to clip them. Sheldon thinks Howard's suit looks bad, but Howard's arms are waving. Penny wants Howard to explain to her why his Facebook page has a picture of him sleeping on his shoulder with his girlfriend captioned 'Me and his girlfriend'. Howard tried to blow up his head, but no one tried to do it. No one hit him, but Howard hit him. He was hit by someone. Howard tried to blow up student one's head, but it didn't work. He hit student two instead. He will see about that. (IN MANDARIN)
s01e10	"Leonard explains to Sheldon that the liquid-metal terminators were created in the future by Skynet and developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2. Sheldon asks Leonard to explain why. Skynet created a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot as a lure for John Connor. Sheldon is surprised that Skynet has a teen fetishes. Penny wants to go out tonight, but Leonard and Sheldon don't know what ""Out Tonight"" is. They would hate it if cats could sing. Leonard is going to mail some letters and throw away some chicken. Penny wants Sheldon to prowl and take her night owl. Sheldon and Leonard are not interested. Leonard wants Penny and Sheldon to throw away some chicken. Sheldon doesn't know what just happened and doesn't want to guess. Leonard is giving up. Penny auditioned for Rent but she didn't get it and she couldn't figure out why. Sheldon has a conclusion based on an observation and experimentation. The girl picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked Penny to replace her. Penny and Leonard are going to see a movie this Friday at 8. Leonard and Penny are going to a symposium on molecular positronium on Friday at 8 pm. Sheldon will join them a week from Tuesday at 6. Leonard lied to Penny and she didn't show any physiological response. Sheldon thinks that lying while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath. Leonard is not worried about Sheldon's safety. Sheldon doesn't want Leonard to kill him, because he would have done it a long time ago. Leonard thinks that's true, but Sheldon disagrees. Sheldon needs to speak to Leonard, but Leonard doesn't want to talk to him. Sheldon needs to get in touch with him, because it's important. Leonard woke Sheldon up in the middle of a REM cycle. Sheldon doesn't want to talk to Leonard, so they will wait until the morning to talk. Leonard and Penny lied to Penny. Sheldon would have told her the truth, but it would have hurt her feelings. He would have suggested something to the effect of going to Penny afterwards. Leonard will have a CAT scan to look for a tumor on Sheldon's brain. Leonard can't wait to hear Sheldon sing again, because he enjoyed his last performance. Leonard and Sheldon played chess earlier. Sheldon is proud of his friend who is not a good chess player. Sheldon wants to play with Leonard again. Sheldon was analyzing their lie and he believes they're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse. Sheldon is knocking on the door. Leonard doesn't answer. Leonard and Sheldon's pants are on fire. Sheldon explains to Leonard how to get to the seminar on molecular positronium on socalphysicsgroup.org. Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today. Sheldon's watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second. Sheldon has no idea what time it is, because it's not accurate. Leonard told Penny they couldn't come to the symposium on molecular positronium because they were attending a symposium. Leonard lied. Sheldon feels uncomfortable about it. Sheldon feels uncomfortable about the fact that he lied. Penny is hungry and tired, so she doesn't know what to do about it. She's not a good liar. Sheldon told her that Leonard lied to her to protect him. Leonard is not seeing the help. Sheldon has a bad feeling about it. Sheldon is hungry. Sheldon and Penny are going to participate in Penny's cousin Leopold's drug intervention on Friday night. The details are important to Sheldon and Leonard. Sheldon has a cousin Leopold, but he made him up. Leonard doesn't understand why he should tell her a different lie. Sheldon's lie is more transparent than Leonard's. Leonard will go to a drug intervention for Sheldon's cousin, Leopold Houston, who has been using drugs for a long time and is now on eHarmony.com. Leonard is going to a drug intervention for Sheldon's cousin Leo. Sheldon doesn't drive. Sheldon and Leonard will leave the house on Friday night and return in the wee hours of the next day. Leonard lied to Penny to convince Leo to go back to rehab. Leo can relapse if Penny invites him to hear her sing again. Sheldon wants to spare Leonard the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin. Leonard will lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena and go to a drug intervention in Long Beach. Penny will operate as if the original lie is still in force. Leonard and Sheldon are pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach, when in actuality, they're pretending to be going to an intervention in the city. Leonard and Penny are going to a symposium. Penny wants to come by and wish Leonard luck. Leonard will not let his friend go alone, because he is a good friend. Penny is on her way to perform in a one-night showcase production of Rent. Leonard has a symposium to go to. Penny and Howard will stand by Leonard. Penny is on her way to perform in a one-night showcase production of Rent. Sheldon is going to a symposium on molecular positronium given by Dr. Emil Farmanfarmian. Leonard and Penny are going to tell Chewbacca and Princess Leia that it's Leonard's Millennium Falcon and they will find some other way to spend the evening. Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis. He made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr. Farmanfarmian. Sheldon doesn't see a problem with that. He made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr. Farmanfarmian. He didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed. Penny's cousin Leo escaped rehab and he's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach. Leonard is going to drive Sheldon to Long Beach to help him with his cousin Leo, who escaped rehab and is staying in a Motel 8 in Long Beach. Leonard and Sheldon are not going to Long Beach. Sheldon doesn't have a drug-addicted cousin Leopold. The Queen Mary is docked there. Once the largest liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a murder-mystery dinner. Raj, Howard and Sheldon will go there. Raj, Sheldon and Leonard are going to Long Beach. Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it's iffy. Sheldon has been doing research on addiction and he thinks there's a problem with the current version of their lie. The murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not. Leonard thinks it's fine, she bought it, it's over. Sheldon thinks Leo would not have agreed to go to rehab, because he's a middle child. Leonard thinks there's no Leo. Sheldon thinks Leo is the quintessential middle child from a broken home and the attention he gets by rebelling is more valuable than help he would get at rehab. Leonard and Sheldon are in a predicament because of Sheldon's deceit. Sheldon is trying to clean up after Leonard's mess. Leonard wants Sheldon to get out. I'm just trying to clean up after your mess. SHELDON We'll talk in the morning. Leonard's cousin Leo is Sheldon's cousin. Leo is 26 years old and originally from Denton, Texas. Leo was a Navy brat. Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo. Man is originally from Denton, Texas, but he was a Navy brat. He was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world. As a result, he felt like an outsider, which is probably the reason for his substance-abuse problem. Toby Loobenfeld is a research assistant in the particle-physics lab at MIT. He also minored in theater and physics at MIT, and he was a double major in Theater and Physics. Leonard and Sheldon would have talked Leo into leaving the motel and coming home with them. Toby was abused in the Philippines by a Navy chaplain when he was 14. Toby was abused in the Philippines by a clubfooted Navy chaplain. He has a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production. Sheldon wants Toby to have fun with it and play it subtextually. Penny and Sheldon had an intervention, but they weren't able to convince him to go to rehab. They convinced him to leave the motel and come say hello to Penny. Sheldon, Toby and Penny are worried about Leo. Penny is Leo's friend and neighbor. Leo was in a motel and woke up next to a transsexual prostitute. Toby asks Penny a question. Penny's showcase last night was okay. Toby didn't like seeing her next to a transsexual prostitute, but both Leo and Penny seemed to like it. There were only two people there at the end, but they both seemed to like it. Chaplain Horrigan was responsible for the low turnout. Toby is in the Philippines. Toby and Sheldon discuss addiction and genetic predisposition towards addiction. There have been studies, but there are no double-blind studies, so there is no control group. Leonard and Penny are going to meet for coffee. Penny sent Leonard a video of her singing last night. Leonard is coming over to watch her. Toby's parents made the right decision. Toby can't work like this. Toby's father failed to provide him with the companionship and the wisdom that his own father didn't. Toby is watching a man speaking on TV. It's a man who is speaking in an offensive way. He's speaking on the TV, too. Toby is sitting on a couch watching TV with a woman. Penny thinks Toby is a sweet, funny and funny guy. Toby is taking it one day at a time. Toby and Penny are taking it one day at a time. Sheldon and Leonard are wondering how long the homeless drug addict is going to stay here and where he will go."

Leonard is not going to wait for him to sit down or stand on the coffee table. Leonard is going to assert his dominance face to face. Sheldon and Leonard are alpha males. Leonard and Penny are at a party. Sheldon is a zebra and Kurt is an elf. Sheldon's costume is a scathing indictment of the American education system.

Just a little experiment in pest control. RAJESH I grew up in India... ...a subcontinent where cows walk in the street... ...and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement. No ...and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement. SHELDON how long you can hold out. We'll just see how your noxious gas fares... ...against my cinnamon-apple-scented aromatherapy candles.

Howard and Raj had a pact not to do that. Sheldon points out that his friends are saying ""Maggie McGarry"" instead. Leonard offered his sister his heart, but she stomped on it hard. Raj doesn't believe it, because it's a betrayal of his trust. Raj dropped his iPhone in a urinal. Howard didn't tell Raj about it out of respect for him. He would never betray Raj's trust. Leonard, Sheldon and Howard are laughing at Raj's story about the time he dropped his iPhone in a urinal. Howard convinced Raj to give back his Snoopy Sno-Cone maker. Sheldon put moths in Leonard's food as an experiment to determine at what concentration the food starts tasting mothy. She did it for science, not betrayal. Raj used Sheldon's toothbrush to pick food from his teeth and massage his gums for science. Leonard and Leonard are shocked that Raj kissed his sister with a moth mouth. Leonard is sorry that he broke his pact with Howard. They are friends and will overlook each other's minor lapses as long as they are friends. Howard is sorry about his phone and Thanksgiving. Raj is sorry he used Sheldon's toothbrush. He doesn't have to wash his clothes on the 4th of July. Raj got Sheldon a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving. Sheldon and Raj are no longer friends, because of Raj's behaviour. Sheldon is watching Raj. Leonard wants to have a snow cone. Sheldon sends him a flavor of Snoopy ice cream.

Howard and Penny are excited about the new technology. Sheldon thinks it's a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree. Sheldon wants to know if there is peace. Howard doesn't want to talk about it. It's not peace, it's something else. Howard borrowed a napkin holder from Amy at the dry-cleaner's and is using it as a napkins holder for NASA. Amy made a pun about it. Sheldon (phone gives text alert)Oh, Amy's at the dry-cleaner's and she's made a very amusing pun. Ahem. 'I don't care for perchloroethylene and I don't like glycol ether.'

I've been thinking that, given the parameters of your experiment... ...the transport of electrons through the nano-fabricated rings... ...is no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the ring... ...already demonstrated the electric analogue... ...of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect. ...of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect. That's it. That's all I know. Oh, wait. Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.

She decided she doesn't need to be a scientist, she could just look like one. Penny wants to look like a scientist, so she bought glasses. Leonard thinks she looks smart and hot, but he doesn't think that's going to change.

s08e05	"Raj read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking. Leonard, Howard and Sheldon had the same idea years ago, but they didn't do anything with it. Penny moved in September 22, 2007. Sheldon had just composed his annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss's death. Two days later, Penny moved in. Leonard didn't pursue that idea because he was told he was old. Since meeting Penny, Raj's greatest accomplishments are sleeping with Penny and getting engaged to her.

When he met Bernadette, the field of robotics took a hit. Leonard and Sheldon are confused. Leonard, Howard and Sheldon are going to come up with a new name for theErgonomic heated seat cushion.

Raj, Leonard, Sheldon and Howard are going to watch Back to the Future II. Raj will make popcorn and they will watch the movie together. I'll make the popcorn. Penny and Amy are in Vegas.

In 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in. Howard, Leoanard and Biff are talking about a Hot Tub Time Machine. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Biff didn't place his first bet until 1955. Leoanard informs Sheldon that in 1955 Biff placed his first bet. It wasn't until his 21st birthday that Biff made his second bet. Sheldon is confused. Leonard, Sheldon and Howard discuss Biff's timeline. Biff will have made his first bet at his 21st birthday, but he had will haven't placed it. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, he alters the timeline. Biff gets the almanac in 1955. Biff creates an alternate future in which Marty and Doc Brown never use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty never brought the timeMachine. Leonard told Sheldon that Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is the same as the one in 2015. Sheldon and Raj agree that the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the one in which he doesn't get it and never has.

Raj advises Howard and Sheldon to look it up online. Leonard thinks Mrs. Florida looks like a wiener. Sheldon and Howard will get back to work. Sheldon, Howard and Raj will use operant conditioning techniques to keep from getting off topic. The techniques were used to teach pigeons to play ping-pong, but Raj is sceptical. Leonard and Raj discuss operant conditioning with punishment. Raj suggests not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong as a punishment for straying off topic. Raj, Howard, Sheldon and Leonard would like to have a scold's bridle to punish idle chatter. They would also like to snap a rubber band on their wrists whenever they get sidetracked. Oh! I'll check Amazon. Amy had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there. Bernadette and Penny told her it was them the whole time, so it was working. Amy and Bernadette are at a place that has Australian male strippers. Amy won $100 playing craps and wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress. Penny will join them.

Bill Murray got it wrong. Howard, Leonard, Sheldon and Raj are going to watch the whole movie. Leonard, Sheldon and Raj have wasted a lot of time watching Back to the Future II. Sheldon didn't see them bust one ghost, but they saw pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries and genitals. Leonard and Sheldon are going to watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop in Leonard's lab on a Saturday night. They didn't see them bust one ghost. It really does hold up. Penny doesn't want to go to the pool, because it's bright out and she should close the curtains. Only nerds and losers stay in the room, so Penny won't go. Penny should close the drapes, but Bernadette wants Amy to do it too, because it's too bright. Amy will do it."

The money comes from the swear jar. Bernadettes private bathroom was supposed to be for the whole floor, but it was only for Wheelchairs Kathy, Wheelchairathy and Bernadnette.

Dan wants to buy an espresso machine for Bernadette's office. Penny thinks it's a good idea. They landed on Bernadettes bathroom instead.
